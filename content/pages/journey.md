Some worked out, some didn’t, but it’s all part of the journey. Let’s dive in!</p>\n    <hr style=\"border: 2px double white; width: 75%; margin: 10px 0;\">\n    \n</div>\n\n<h4>2015: The Harlem Shake Dreams</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">I had this hilarious idea to make my own version of the Harlem Shake. Planned it all out... but never actually uploaded it. (Classic me, right?) Eventually, I moved on.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>April 2017: Mr.Tech is Born</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">I launched my first YouTube channel, \"Mr.Tech.\" It was all about DIY projects, cool gadgets, and life hacks—without me saying a word! \U0001F4F7 But after a while, I let it fade away.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>September 2017: Enter Batteryy</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Decided to switch things up and rebranded \"Mr.Tech\" to \"Batteryy.\" New name, new vibe. \U0001F4F7 Though eventually, I shifted my focus elsewhere.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>February 2018: Savage Vlogs</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Started vlogging my everyday life with a new channel called \"Savage Vlogs.\" It was mostly home-life stuff—just me being me. But eventually, life got in the way, and I stopped vlogging.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>2018-2019: PUBG Fever</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Got super into PUBG. It was a blast... until I realized I was wasting hours (and hours) of my life on it. Eventually, I put the controller down for good.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>2020: The SDE Dream (Briefly)</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Thought I’d dive into the world of coding and become a Software Development Engineer (SDE). Started learning Python... and stopped after a week. Oops. The enthusiasm quickly wore off.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>June 2023: Rohan Shetty - The New Chapter</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Inspired by legends like Ryan Trahan and Mr. Beast, I launched a new channel under my own name, \"Rohan Shetty.\" I invested around 1.5 lakhs in gear and made some solid content. But after some time, I decided to step away from it.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>September 2023: Shorts Challenge</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">I decided to take on a daily shorts challenge for \"Rohan Shetty.\" Managed to create 20 videos in two weeks, but I lost steam after that. Fun fact: The first video was actually uploaded in September 2024 (don’t ask, time is weird like that). Eventually, I lost interest and moved on.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>April 2024: Adventure Awaits</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Bought myself an adventure bike with all my savings! \U0001F3CD Time to hit the open road and live a little.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>April 2024: Business Mode Activated</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Came up with the idea of selling a spark slider and invested 30k into it. Sold around 10 products organically before I lost focus after about a month and a half. The business idea fizzled out after a while.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>June 2024: The Idly Vada Channel</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Launched a new channel where I shared random thoughts while riding my bike and speaking Tulu. Recorded a few videos but, you guessed it, never uploaded them. Eventually, I let this project go as well.</p>\n<hr style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;\">\n\n<h4>August 2024: A New Focus</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">I’ve discovered something new at work that has truly captured my attention. I have a fresh goal in mind, and I’m all in! I’m working very hard towards it and feeling excited about what’s next!</p>\n"
