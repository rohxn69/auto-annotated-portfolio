          <h4>YouTube Vlogger: 2016</h4>
          <p>Ah, the good old days when I started making YouTube videos, influenced by Jake Paul and Logan Paul. I still get cringe attacks whenever I watch that video. Hahaha!</p>

          <h4>Job 1</h4>
          <p>Reflecting on those early days, I remember how much fun it was to create content. It's funny to think about how far I've come since then!</p>
